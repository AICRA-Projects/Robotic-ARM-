The Industrial Robotic Arm
An industrial robot arm is a marvel of engineering in that it reacts similarly to our own arms. The robot arm closely resembles a human arm, with a wrist, forearm, elbow and shoulder. The six-axis robot has six degrees of freedom, allowing it to move six different ways, unlike the human arm, which has seven degrees of freedom.
Industrial robotic arms move much faster than human arms and, without the proper safety measures, can be dangerous. Robotic arms usually have some form of safety package or sensors available to ensure the safety of human workers.
An industrial robot arm not only increases the speed of the manufacturing process, but also the accuracy and precision. These robotic arms cut down on worker error and labor costs.The industrial robotic arm, which is usually made of steel or cast iron is built from the base up, ending with the wrist and whatever end effector is needed to perform the arm’s chosen task. A robotic controller rotates motors that are attached to each joint. Some of the larger arms, used to lift heavy payloads, are run by hydraulic and pneumatic means.
The arm’s job moves the end effector from place to place – picking up, putting down, taking off or welding a part or the entire work piece. These robotic arms can be programmed to do several different jobs or one specific job, depending on the manufacturer’s specifications and needs.
# Robotic arm configuration

## Servo Motor Features:
* The unit comes complete with 30cm wire and 3 pin 'S' type female header connector that fits 
most receivers, including Futaba, JR, GWS, Cirrus, Blue Bird, Blue Arrow, Corona, Berg, 
Spektrum and Hitec. 
This high-speed standard servo can rotate approximately 120 degrees (60 in each direction). 
You can use any servo code, hardware or library to control these servos, so it's great for 
beginners who want to make stuff move without building a motor controller with feedback & 
gear box, especially since it will fit in small places. The MG995 Metal Gear Servo also 
comes with a selection of arms and hardware to get you set up nice and fast!

## Microcontroller Board:
Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people just starting out with electronics, and for good reason. Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need a separate piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load new code onto the board -- you can simply use a USB cable. Additionally, the Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++, making it easier to learn to program. Finally, Arduino provides a standard form factor that breaks out the functions of the micro-controller into a more accessible package.
